# [Project 7: HR-Analytics- SQL & Tableau Visualization](https://github.com/ron0496/Data-analysis-and-Data-viz-Projects/tree/main/HR-Analytics-Project)

### About Project:

The HR Analytics Dashboards project aims to leverage various data visualization and analysis tools to provide meaningful insights into HR data. By analyzing key HR metrics, such as job satisfaction, attrtion rates, education, and age, this dashboard can assist HR professionals in making informed decisions and identifying areas for improvement.

In this project, I developed HR analytics dashboards Tableau and SQL. I gathered HR data from various sources, transformed it using SQL queries, and then visualized the data using Tableau. The dashboards cover a wide range of HR metrics, including employee demographics, performance analysis, attrition rates, and department analysis. Each dashboard provides interactive visualizations and filters to allow users to explore the data and gain actionable insights.

Tools Used
* Tableau: Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
* SQL: Employed for querying and manipulating the HR data.

### Dashboard overview:

According to the insights derived :

* The average attrition Rate in the company is around 16% with males almost double the number of females, with an average age of 37 years. A lower attrition rate indicates better workforce stability.
* R&D department has the highest rate of attrition of 56% among others. Moreover, employees with Life Science as educational background are seen to be more prone to depart the organisation.
* Job Satisfaction is highest with job roles as Sales Executive and Research Scientist.
