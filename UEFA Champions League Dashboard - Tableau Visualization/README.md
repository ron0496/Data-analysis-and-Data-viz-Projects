### About Project:
The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club football competition organized by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through a group and knockout format. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. The data being used in this case study is taken from Kaggle and can be found here [UEFA Champions League Historical Dataset 1955-2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fardifaalam170041060/champions-league-dataset-1955-2023). This data includes statistics up to the final of the 2022/23 season. 
Note: This doesn't have any information about the European cup competition (1950-1992). It starts with the beginning of the Champions league (1992/93) season.
