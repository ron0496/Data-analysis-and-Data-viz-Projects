# [Project 6: Goodread books analysis](https://github.com/ron0496/Data-analysis-and-Data-viz-Projects/tree/main/Goodread%20books%20analysis)

### About Project:
As one of the worldâ€™s most influential reading sites, Goodreads provides a platform for people interested in talking about books. Word of mouth is one of the most powerful driving forces for book recommendation, and the social attributes of Goodreads have magnified the word-of-mouth effect of books. This goodreads datasets contains all the listed books on GoodRead books platform. The datset contain 12 columns, which include the books infromation and the rating and reviews count. The dataset in this project is from Kaggle about [GoodReads books](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks/data).

* Some of the top rated books and top 20 authors
